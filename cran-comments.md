## Submission (24-Nov-2021)

Sorry about the rapid resubmission (only after 2 days). I received an e-mail from Professor Brian Ripley about memory check problem. The problem is now fixed (I have checked with local valgrind and valgrind on rhub).

Once again, sorry about the rapid resubmission. Thank you very much for your work. Vielen Dank für Ihre Mühe!
