The goal of sweater (**S**peedy **W**ord **E**mbedding **A**ssociation
**T**est & **E**xtras using **R**) is to test for biases in word
embeddings.

The package provides functions that are speedy. They are either
implemented in C++, or are speedy but accurate approximation of the
original implementation proposed by Caliskan et al (2017).

This package provides extra methods such as Relative Norm Distance,
SemAxis and Relative Negative Sentiment Bias.

If your goal is to reproduce the analysis in Caliskan et al (2017),
please consider using the [original Java
program](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DX4VWP&version=2.0)
or the R package [cbn](https://github.com/conjugateprior/cbn) by Lowe.
To reproduce the analysis in Garg et al (2018), please consider using
the [original Python
program](https://github.com/nikhgarg/EmbeddingDynamicStereotypes). To
reproduce the analysis in Mazini et al (2019), please consider using the
[original Python
program](https://github.com/TManzini/DebiasMulticlassWordEmbedding/).

## Installation

You can install the Github version of sweater with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("chainsawriot/sweater")
```

## Notation of a query

All tests in this package use the concept of queries (see Badilla et
al., 2020) to study the biases in the input word embeddings `w`. This
package uses the “STAB” notation from Brunet et al (2019).

All tests depend on two types of words. The first type, namely, `S` and
`T`, is *target words* (or *neutral words* in Garg et al). These are
words that **should** have no bias. For instance, the words such as
“nurse” and “professor” can be used as target words to study the
gender bias in word embeddings. One can also seperate these words into
two sets, `S` and `T`, to group words by their perceived bias. For
example, Caliskan et al. (2017) grouped target words into two groups:
mathematics (“math”, “algebra”, “geometry”, “calculus”, “equations”,
“computation”, “numbers”, “addition”) and arts (“poetry”, “art”,
“dance”, “literature”, “novel”, “symphony”, “drama”, “sculpture”).
Please note that also `T` is not always required.

The second type, namely `A` and `B`, is *attribute words* (or *group
words* in Garg et al). These are words with known properties in relation
to the bias that one is studying. For example, Caliskan et al. (2017)
used gender-related words such as “male”, “man”, “boy”, “brother”, “he”,
“him”, “his”, “son” to study gender bias. These words qualify as
attribute words because we know they are related to a certain gender.

All functions follow the same template: `test(w, S, T, A, B)`. One can
then extract the effect size of the test using `test_es`.

## Example: Mean Average Cosine Similarity

The simplest form of bias detection is Meab Average Cosine Similarity
(Mazini et al. 2019). The same method is used also in Kroon et
al. (2020).

## Example: Relative Norm Distance

This analysis reproduces the analysis in Garg et al (2018), namely
Figure 1. Please note that `T` is not required.

``` r

"photographer", "geologist", "shoemaker", "athlete", "cashier", 
"dancer", "housekeeper", "accountant", "physicist", "gardener",

"girls", "females", "sisters", "aunt", "aunts", "niece", "nieces"
)

garg_f1 <- rnd(googlenews, S, A, B)
```

Words such as “nurse”, “midwife” and “librarian” are more associated
with female, as indicated by the positive relative norm distance.

```

The effect size is simply the sum of all relative norm distance values
(Equation 3 in Garg et al. 2018). The more positive value indicates that
words in S are more associated with `B`. As the effect size is negative,
it indicates that the concept of occupation is more associated with `A`,
i.e. male.

``` r
rnd_es(garg_f1)
#> [1] -6.341598
```

## Example: SemAxis

This analysis attempts to reproduce the analysis in An et al. (2018).
Please note that `T` is not required.

You may obtain the word2vec word vectors trained with Trump supporters
Reddit from [here](https://github.com/ghdi6758/SemAxis).

``` r
S <- c("mexicans", "asians", "whites", "blacks", "latinos")
A <- c("respect")
B <- c("disrespect")
res <- semaxis(reddit, S, A, B, l = 1)
res$P
#>    mexicans      asians      whites      blacks     latinos 
#> -0.16402445 -0.10867685 -0.10599096 -0.07974000 -0.04583781
```

## Example: Relative Negative Sentiment Bias

This analysis attempts to reproduce the analysis in Sweeney & Najafian
(2019). Please note that `T` is not required.

``` r
S <- c("swedish", "irish", "mexican", "chinese", "filipino",
       "german", "english", "french", "norwegian", "american",
       "indian", "dutch", "russian", "scottish", "italian")
sn <- rnsb(glove_sweeney, S, bing_pos, bing_neg)
```

The analysis shows that `indian`, `mexican`, and `russian` are more
likely to be associated with negative sentiment.

``` r
sort(sn$P)
#>     italian     chinese    scottish     swedish      german     english 
#> 0.002163469 0.006698797 0.009301426 0.011642360 0.013898265 0.019882906 
#>      french    filipino   norwegian       irish       dutch    american 
#> 0.024725367 0.025962431 0.034289040 0.044816897 0.075287071 0.079399144 
#>     russian     mexican      indian 
#> 0.162676050 0.183219913 0.306036864
```

The effect size from the analysis is the Kullback–Leibler divergence of
P from the uniform distribution. It is extremely close to the value
reported in the original paper (0.6225).

``` r
rnsb_es(sn)
#> [1] 0.6228853
```

## Support for Quanteda Dictionary

`rnsb` supports quanteda dictionary as `S`. `rnd` and `weat` will
support it later.

For example, `newsmap_europe` is an abridged dictionary from the package
newsmap (Watanabe, 2018). The dictionary contains keywords of European
countries and has two levels: regional level (e.g. Eastern Europe) and
country level (e.g. Germany).

Region-level analysis

```

Comparison of the two effect sizes. Please note the much smaller effect
size from region-level analysis. It reflects the evener distribution of
P acorss regions than across countries.

## Example: Normalized Association Score

Normalized Association Score (Caliskan et al., 2017) is similar to
Relative Norm Distance above. Please note that `T` is not required.

There is a very strong correlation between NAS and RND.

## Example: Word Embedding Association Test

This example reproduces the detection of “Math. vs Arts” gender bias in
Caliskan et al (2017).

``` r
data(glove_math) # a subset of the original GLoVE word vectors

S <- c("math", "algebra", "geometry", "calculus", "equations", "computation", "numbers", "addition")
T <- c("poetry", "art", "dance", "literature", "novel", "symphony", "drama", "sculpture")
A <- c("male", "man", "boy", "brother", "he", "him", "his", "son")
B <- c("female", "woman", "girl", "sister", "she", "her", "hers", "daughter")
sw <- weat(glove_math, S, T, A, B)

# extraction of effect size
weat_es(sw)
#> [1] 1.055015
```

## A note about the effect size

By default, the effect size from the function `weat_es` is adjusted by
the pooled standard deviaion (see Page 2 of Caliskan et al. 2007). The
standardized effect size can be interpreted the way as Cohen’s d (Cohen,
1988).

One can also get the unstandardized version (aka. test statistic in the
original paper):

``` r
weat_es(sw, standardize = FALSE)
#> [1] 0.02486533
```

The original implementation assumes equal size of `S` and `T`. This
assumption can be relaxed by pooling the standard deviaion with sample
size adjustment. The function `weat_es` does it when `S` and `T` are of
different length.

Also, the effect size can be converted to point-biserial correlation
(mathematically equivalent to the Pearson’s product moment correlation).

``` r
weat_es(sw, r = TRUE)
#> [1] 0.4912066
```

## Exact test

The exact test described in Caliskan et al. (2017) is also available.
But it takes a long time to calculate.

``` r
## Don't do it. It takes a long time and is almost always significant.
weat_exact(sw)
```

Instead, please use the resampling approximaton of the exact test. The
p-value is very close to the reported 0.018.

``` r
weat_resampling(sw)
#> 
#>  Resampling approximation of the exact test in Caliskan et al. (2017)
#> 
#> data:  sweater_obj
#> bias = 0.024865, p-value = 0.0171
#> alternative hypothesis: true bias is greater than 7.245425e-05
#> sample estimates:
#>       bias 
#> 0.02486533
```
