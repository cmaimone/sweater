\title{Relative Negative Sentiment Bias}
\usage{
rnsb(w, S, A, B, levels = 1, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{w}{a numeric matrix of word embeddings (e.g. from rsparse::GloVe)}

\item{S}{a character vector of the first set of target words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include occupations such as programmer, engineer, scientists...}

\item{A}{a character vector of the first set of attribute words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include words such as man, male, he, his.}

\item{B}{a character vector of the second set of attribute words. In an example of studying gender stereotype, it can include words such as woman, female, she, her.}

\item{verbose}{logical, whether to display information}
}
\value{
A list with class \code{"rnsb"} containing the following components:
\describe{
\item{\code{$classifer}}{ a logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with LiblineaR}
\item{\code{$A}}{the input A}
\item{\code{$B}}{the input B}
\item{\code{$S}}{the input S}
\item{\code{$P}}{the predicted negative sentiment probabilities}
}
\code{\link{rnsb_es}} can be used to obtain the effect size of the test.
}
\description{
This function estimate the Relative Negative Sentiment Bias (RNSB) of word embeddings (Sweeney & Najafian, 2019).
